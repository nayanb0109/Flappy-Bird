# Flappy-Bird

Flappy bird is a simple fun arcade game where the user prevents the bird from colliding with the 
poles. This simple but fun game help to reduce stress and gives the feeling of enjoyment. We have 
tried to recreate the game with adding some new features so the user feels compelling to play the 
game. We have added features like day and night mode different bird skins and background. We 
have also added reverse gravity mode where the bird moves upwards instead of downwards.
